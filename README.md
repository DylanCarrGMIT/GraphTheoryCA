#Dylan Carr Graphy Theory Repo
This repository exists to demonstrate what I've learned over the course of the Graph Theory module.
Contained are 2 Jupyter Notebooks, one on the Heap Sort sorting algorithm, and one on the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

#Running the Notebooks
To run either of these Jupyter Notebooks, you must first install Jupyter Notebook itself. This can be achieved by running the command "pip install notebook".
Once it is installed, you can run the command "jupyter notebook" in the directory with the ipynb files, which should run Jupyter Notebook.
From there, just click on the ipynb file you wish to access.
